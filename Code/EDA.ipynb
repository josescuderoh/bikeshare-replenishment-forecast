    "- The top 10 origin and destination stations were found. These 10 stations out of 266 (3.6%) account for the 13% and 14% of all trips, respectively. To create a first modeling approach, we will only analyze bike supply and demand for the top station, which is **Union Station**, accounting for a 2% and 2.6% as origin and destination, respectively.\n",
    "- During 2017, 63.102 bikes were taken from and to Union Station in total. Considering the 5.000 bikes available today, and Union Station's average of 172 bikes a day, with a maximum of nearly 500 bikes, *up to 10% of all bikes could be used* at this station alone. Furthermore, this mean goes up to 213 bikes during weekdays, which means trips are mainly skewed towards weekdays instead of weekends.\n",
    "- A surrogate variable was created in order to approximate the demand of bikes at Union Station for every hour of every day of the year 2017. This variable is called **rate of change** and, is calculated as the amount of trips leaving the station minus the amount of trips arriving to the station. We will have a signed number that will describe the deficit or surplus of bikes for every hour, respectively.\n",
    "- Union Station has a -1.2 average rate of change, meaning that on average *more bikes will arrive to the station than those leaving the station*. In terms of operations, this station will have a surplus of bikes that need to be taken from the station. \n",
    "- Peak hours present 49 bikes arriving to the station (almost twice the station's capacity) and 26 bikes leaving the station (full station capacity).\n",
    "- For weekends, the average rate of change tends to zero (with low variance), which means a balanced supply and demand. This means that on average, *we will not need resources for bike replenishment at Union Station on weekends*.\n",
    "- For weekdays, morning hours have a positive rate of change on average and, until 6 AM a neutral rate of change. Demand peaks at 7 AM, in which the capacity is enough to satisfy the demand of about 10 bikes. This capacity seems to be optmial and we will not need replenishment.\n",
    "- For weekdays' afternoons the opposite is the case. With negative rates of change from 3 PM until 10 PM, *we will need to remove a significant amount of bikes during afternoon hours*, even more during peak hours (from 2 to 6) the capacity of the station will be exceeded many times as users will arrive and have nowhere to park their bikes. Users could even incur in overage.\n",
    "- For every hour of the day, the mean and standard deviation of the rate of change will be within the capacity of the station, which is optimal for operations.\n",
    "- Extreme values are present at 4 PM, the \"ride back home\", in which the station's capacity is exceeded. However, the \"ride to work\" is not symmetric to this number. This station is used for the trip back home more than the trip to work.\n",
    "- Wednesday is the day that presents the *most negative peaks* for rate of change, followed in similar magnitudes by Tuesday, Thursday and Monday. On a Friday is rare to have a bike surplus."

    "* The overall mean value of the rate of change is negative, meaning that, on average, *the inventory of bikes is increasing by 1.2 bikes every hour*, and 1.4 bikes for weekdays. We could conclude that for this station we will not require bike replenishment, on the contrary, bikes will need to be removed from the station to free up capacity for incoming riders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even with outliers removed, the minimum is significantly low and would imply an arrival of bikes greater than the capacity of the station which is 26 bikes and, maybe the capacity of one replenishment truck. This variable would help us identify the hours of the day in which that is likely to happen and act accordingly.\n",

    "- For weekdays, morning hours imply a positive rate of change on average and, until 6 AM a near-zero rate of change. Demand peaks at 7 AM, in which the capacity is enough to satisfy an average demand of about 10 bikes. The capacity is optimal for this demand and we do not need to replenish bikes at Union Station.\n",

    "* During afternoon we have the opposite, with **negative rates of change from 3 PM until 10 PM**. We will need to remove a significant amount of bikes during afternoon hours, even more during peak inflow hours (from 2 to 6) the capacity of the station will be exceeded users might arrive without anywhere to park their bikes, this might lead users to incur in overage affecting the service and even the probability of churn.\n",

    "* We see that these peaks are mostly at 4 PM (busy hour for commuting), which is consistent with the data previously reviewed. At this time of the day, a large number of bikes are taken to this station for the \"ride back home\". However, it's interesting that the \"ride to work\" is not symmetric to this number. This station is used for getting home from work but not as much for getting to work.\n",
    "* Almost every day of the week at 4 PM we will have an overflow of bikes at this station, however, at 5 PM and 8 PM is quite rare.\n",
    "* Wednesday is the day that presents the most peaks for rate of change, followed in simmilar proportion by Tuesday, Thursday and Monday. On a Friday is rare to have a bike overflow.\n",
    "* Also, we have a mean of one peak a day for this station, this insight could optimize the trips taken to Union Station to pick up bikes."
